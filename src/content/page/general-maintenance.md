title: General Maintenance
---

Folks, the list for general maintenance is long.
[Please call me](tel:0404222244), I am happy just to visit you and take a walk
around the house. _No commitment required from you._

- **Leaking taps** should be reseated and washers
- **Hot Water Systems** If youâ€™ve got a Dux with plastic plugs, call me A.S.A.P.
  Your temperature pressure & relief valve should be in good working order and
  activated monthly
- **Roof and Downpipe leaks** if left will cause damage to walls floors and
  foundations
- **Exposed copper pipes** the salt air here in Port Macquarie means you will
  need to either change to poly, or have a good paint over
- **Water usage auditing**
- **Leaking o-rings** cause vanity units to swell due to water damage
