**Report Plumbing** is owned and operated by me, Ben Whitehair.

I have over 25 years experience in the trade. When I'm not weilding a
pipe-wrench, you can find me behind a BBQ at
[The Meating Place](https://www.facebook.com/themeatingplace2444).

Some of my career highlights include:

- I installed and commissioned the hot water system for the crocodile enclosure
  at **Taronga Zoo**
- I installed and commissioned the multi-stage rainwater tank system for the
  **Ken _(& Judy)_ Done Seaside** property
- I serviced and commissioned **Kerry Packer's** 2x hot water tanks &
  thermostatic mixing valve (dedicated entirely to his ensuite shower!)

My customers aren't just crocodiles and billionaires though — we're a family
business focused on looking after the locals and would love to be your first
port of call when it comes to plumbing solutions.

—Ben
